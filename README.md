# Google Analytics 4 Project – Product Purchase Drop-Off Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **Google Analytics 4 Funnel Exploration Report** and the main aim of this project is to analyze the purchase journey of a User on the Google Merchandise Store.
The goal is to analyse the key steps customer takes before purchase hence I have made funnel consisting the 3 main key events ( view item, add to cart , purchase etc.) as these the 3 most prominent possible steps the User takes before purchasing anything. Through Funnel Exploration I can funnel a huge chunk of Users and will be able to generate insights about their Drop off points, funnel completion rate, at which stage of funnel does User decides to exit. 

**Disclaimer:** This project uses demo data; no real business data is involved.

## ✅ Recommended Actions

- There was also numerous Abandonments seen right after user viewed the product signifying that the product quality can be improved. New line of product can be installed making more options to choose from for the Users.
