## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project is a **Google Analytics 4 Funnel Exploration Report** and the main aim of this project is to analyze the purchase journey of a User on the Google Merchandise Store.
The goal is to analyse the key steps customer takes before purchase hence I have made funnel consisting the 3 main key events ( view item, add to cart , purchase etc.) as these the 3 most prominent possible steps the User takes before purchasing anything. Through Funnel Exploration I can funnel a huge chunk of Users and will be able to generate insights about their Drop off points, funnel completion rate, at which stage of funnel does User decides to exit.
